          <img src="images/studying.jpg" alt="Just My Favorite Guitar Photo" class="img-hobbies">
          <p>I always liked to study. From my early age I loved to discover new things and master them. I just love to make some target and reach it through learning and experience. </p>
          <p>In school my favorite subjects was:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Algebra</li>
            <li>Geometry</li>
            <li>Physics</li>
            <li>IT</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>2. Music</h4>
          <img src="images/music.jpg" alt="Just My Favorite Guitar Photo" class="img-hobbies">
          <p>While I was a kid I was sudying in music school and I was playing synthesizer. When I was 10-12 years old my friend gave me cassette with Linkin Park first album Hybrid Theory, from that time I was fully involved in rock/metal music.</p>
          <p>When I was 15 years old I bought my first guitar and played it a lot with my school band, then with university band. I really enjoyed that time.</p>

          <h4>3. Games</h4>
          <img src="images/games.jpg" alt="Just My Favorite Guitar Photo" class="img-hobbies">
          <p>Games was always part of my life. I always saw in games more art than in movies, books or music. Games are perfect, games are combination of all arts we know in one, with personal experience.</p>
          <p>Also I love in games competition aspect aswell. I spended tons of hours playing different fps, mmo and moba games.</p>
